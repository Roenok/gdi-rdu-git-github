          <h3>Why Use Git?</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Fast! Access information quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Distributed! Everyone has her own local copy.</li>
            <li>Mind-bogglingly scalable! Enabling potentially thousands (millions!) of developers to work on single project.
            <li>Local! You don't need a network connection to use it. You only need a remote server if you want to share your code with others (e.g., using GitHub)</li>
            <li>Branches! Keep your coding experiments separate from code that is already working.</li>
            <li>Everyone has a local copy of the <span class="green">shared files</span> and the <span class="green">history</span></li>

          <h3> Git Best Practices </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Commit early and often</li>
                commits give you a hook into your code, like a bookmark that you can turn back to.
              <li>Don't forget to communicate with real people</li>
              <li>don't wait until something is perfect to commit it, or to push it. Share code to get feedback on it, and to let other people know what you are working on.</li>
              <li>Write good commit messages</li>
              <li>Branches are cheap</li>
              <p>You decide what to track, even within a single project.</p>
          <p>* You can, and should, leave some things out: anything that you are not making changes to: e.g., certain dependencies, .dot files, api keys. Git gives you an easy way to do this (.gitignore).</p>
            </ul>
